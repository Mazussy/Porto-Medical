# Porto Medical Landing Page (HTML + Sass)

A responsive landing page inspired by the Porto Medical WordPress theme. This project is a partial front-end recreation focused on showcasing Sass architecture, custom styling, and clean HTML structure.


## 📌 Project Scope

This project replicates the top section of the [Porto Medical Theme](https://www.portotheme.com/wordpress/porto/medical/) **up to the Doctors section only**, including:

- Header with navigation
- Hero slider
- Our Departments section
- Features and Highlights
- Meet Our Doctors

> ❗ Note: Only static content is implemented — no JavaScript functionality (e.g. slider behavior) is included, as the focus is purely on HTML and Sass.

- Clean and semantic HTML5
